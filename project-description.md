Intended Platform: Android

I chose the Android studio as the intended platform for my final project due to its widespread popularity in the mobile operating system landscape. Android offers a vast user base, diverse device compatibility, and access to a wide range of APIs and features that enable developers to create rich and engaging mobile applications.

Intended Framework/Programming Language: Java

I selected Jave as the intended programming language for my Android app development due to its official support by Google for Android development. It has a widely adopted programming language known for its scalability, performance, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools. Its object-oriented nature and familiarity among developers make it a suitable choice for building robust and feature-rich Android applications.
